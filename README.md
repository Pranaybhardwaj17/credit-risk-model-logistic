This repository contains my solutions to the JPMC Quantitative Research Internship tasks. The program focused on applying quantitative methods, data analysis, and financial modeling to real-world problems faced by the Quantitative Research team at JPMorgan Chase.

üìÇ Tasks Overview
Task 1: Natural Gas Price Modeling

Objective: Analyze natural gas prices, identify seasonal trends, and forecast future values.

Techniques Used:

Data visualization using Matplotlib

Linear regression for trend estimation

Sinusoidal fitting for seasonal variation

Interpolation & extrapolation for price forecasting

Outcome: Built a model capturing both long-term upward trend and annual seasonality in gas prices.

Task 2: Pricing a Gas Storage Contract

Objective: Simulate storage of natural gas by modeling injection and withdrawal strategies.

Techniques Used:

Python-based cash flow simulation

Incorporation of storage, injection, and withdrawal costs

Sequential processing of trade dates

Outcome: Implemented a function to calculate net profit/loss of a storage contract under varying market conditions.

Task 3: Loan Default Prediction

Objective: Build a credit risk model to predict loan defaults.

Techniques Used:

Logistic Regression (scikit-learn)

Feature engineering (debt-to-income, payment-to-income ratios)

Model evaluation using ROC-AUC

Outcome: Developed a supervised learning model that classifies borrowers based on default probability.

Task 4: Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Default Segmentation

Objective: Estimate probability of default across different FICO score ranges using statistical modeling.

Techniques Used:

Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)

Dynamic programming for segmentation

Log-likelihood optimization

Outcome: Segmented borrowers into risk buckets and estimated their default probabilities with MLE.

üõ†Ô∏è Skills Demonstrated

Quantitative Modeling

Regression Analysis (Linear & Logistic)

Probability & Statistics (MLE)

Financial Contract Valuation

Python for Data Analysis (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn)

üìú Summary

This internship enhanced my ability to combine financial intuition with quantitative modeling. I worked on commodity forecasting, contract valuation, and credit risk assessment ‚Äî key areas in asset & wealth management.
